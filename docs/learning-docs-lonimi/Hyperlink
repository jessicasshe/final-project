This is how i finally managed to get my hyperlink to work in my popup screen: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8348063/clickable-links-in-joptionpane#:~:text=bold%22%20:%20%22normal%22),showMessageDialog(null%2C%20ep);%20%7D

- make sure all imports are added to code
    - learnt about these new imports:
      import java.awt.Desktop;
      import java.net.URI;
      import javax.swing.event.HyperlinkEvent;
      import javax.swing.event.HyperlinkListener;
      import javax.swing.JEditorPane;
        -> they are all necessary to make hyperlinks work within your code, along with a bit of html knowledge
- make a seperate obj
- use seperate JOptionPane knowledge to place the hyperlink in the popup

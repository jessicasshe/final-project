#Using Input Streams To Read Image Byte Array Data
--> Call readAllBytes() method 


--> When updating the reading progress in the same window using a popup, the method can just call setValue() and the changes are instantly applied, since its running on the EDT.

--> What is a Event Dispatch Thread? 

Responsible for monitoring the UI updates. Central queue manager to ensure thread safety/conflict management 

-- Use methods like .invokeLater() for data fetching to ensure that processes are done sequentially to avoid freezing windows. 

#Using .invokeLater() methods
--> If you don't use it, the UI may freeze until the data fetch (prev action on the EDT) is finished. 

Ex. The DB Operator holds column data and has methods to fetch and update the data in the database. These tasks run in a WORKER THREAD. 
UI updates must happen on the UI thread, so the UI classes must call the invokeLater() method holding the UI updates. 
(Because if the worker thread was still running the UI would freeze, so invokeLater ensures that the UI is still navigable & that updates will happen after the worker thread is fully complete)

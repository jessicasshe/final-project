- Learned how to debug properly on Netbeans (not available on CodeHS)

--> Set breakpoints by clicking on the code line number
  
--> Hover over variable names to show their live value 

--> https://medium.com/@riaanfnel/crushing-bugs-a-developers-guide-to-debugging-like-a-pro-d673906ae0dc

--> STEP INTO: Enter a function, stop at the first line inside it

--> STEP OVER: Execute the entire function

--> STEP OUT: Execute the remaining lines of a function without stopping 


- Learned how to understand file directory

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/file-directories-explained-by-getting-dressed-in-the-morning-2f5d0a69cdde/
--> /root folder is the top-level directory that contains the entire proj (nothing before the slash)

--> /root folder/subfolder is a subfolder within the root 

--> /root folder/subfolder/file.css accesses a specific file within the subfolder. this is a full path 

--> Absolute paths start from the root path. Relative paths depend on the current working directory in the program 

- Learned importance of closing the statement (task) and result set (result) for each query, and to close the DB connection itself only when the usage is done (like when the user quits the program)

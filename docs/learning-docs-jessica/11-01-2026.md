Updating ResultSets
-> For an individual table(no joined tables), you can call the updateRow() function 
-> Unfortunately NOT work for joined tables, so in order to update the columns of Books and of UsersBooks, you have to do it separately

Adding to Collection:
Save changes button pressed --> Call helper method to update UsersBooks --> Call helper method to update Books --> Popup to select shelf type --> Call method to add to collection 

JavaDocs:
/**

@ param <name> description
@ return <descrption> omit for void methods
@ throws <exception> <description> 

- Use third person.

-> Implement uniqueness for a group of column values
-> Add exception handling: a raised exception will signal a duplicate insert.
(SQLiteConstraintException: when you attempt to insert/update data that violates UNIQUE  / PRIMARY KEY constraint

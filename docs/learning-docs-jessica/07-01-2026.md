- IMPORTANT: Matches a PRIMARY and FOREIGN key. The FOREIGN key refers to the same primary key in a different table.

--> Useful when you want to find Book details associated with a user in UserBooks. 

Ex. Find the corresponding row where 'book_id' column value in Userbooks is equal to 'book_id' column value in Books
-> Return only the row of the Books table!!

- Types of JOINS

1. INNER JOIN: Returns row ONLY when there is a match in BOTH tables (Now you can access all columns!)

2. LEFT OUTER JOIN: Include rows from BOTH tables, matched to the LEFT table rows. If no match exists in RIGHT, null value provided

3. RIGHT OUTER JOIN: Include rows from BOTH tables, matched to the RIGHT table rows. If no match exists in LEFT, null value provided 

4. FULL OUTER JOIN: Return ALL rows where there is a match/no match. 

5. UNION JOIN:  Stacks rows on top of the other

6. CROSS JOIN: Combinations of table rows (1, 1), (1, 2), (1,3)...

--> Writing a join statement:

FROM ___ table_1
INNER/LEFT/RIGHT JOIN ____ table_2
ON table_1.Column_name = table_2.Column_name;

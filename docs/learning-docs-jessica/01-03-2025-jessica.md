# LEARNING LOG - NETBEANS/SQLite

## 2026-01-02
- Connected Github repo to Netbeans so we can commit directly instead of copy/pasting or uploading individual files

--> Click on the main project folder -> go to 'Install Git Repository' -> repeat and click on 'Git' -> connect account -> create an access token -> push code to repo

- Connected SQL database in order to finish & test the login form

--> Tutorial Used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcR1vDPMKP4

- Learned simple queries:
Ex. A select statement to find all rows with all available columns, optionally where the user_id column value equals 2
Note: SQLite isn't case sensitive for the statement types  (select == SELECT)

SELECT * from DATABASE NAME;

(optional: WHERE user_id = 2;)

- Important packages for queries:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html
Statement: Object used to tell the database what to do (Select, Update, Insert, Delete)

ResultSet: A table you get back with selected after the statement's SELECT query which you can loop through

-> Flow: Statement -> ResultSet -> Loop through ResultSet to manipulate / view the data

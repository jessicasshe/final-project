--> Learned about universal date-time formatting into database (notes)

--> Learned about handling unique constraints for pairs:

(CONFLICT ON (item 1, item 2) DO NOTHING / DO REPLACE

--> Learned about unique indexes
Can set a multicolumn unique index to make that combination unique, instead of individual
Ex. User can only have 1 note for a chapter in one book , so the unique index is on (user_id, book_id, chapter)
